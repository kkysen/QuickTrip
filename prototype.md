# Project Title
QuickTrip: An All-in-One Trip Planner

### 1. Project Idea: Ultimate Goal
An application to assist in trip planning. Recommends hotels, flights, rental cars, directions, restaurants, and events to do based on user input. It scrapes information from the Google Maps and TripAdvisor, Travelocity, etc. APIs and plans the optimal trip, start to finish, all costs included, based on some minimal user input, with the option to tune parameters and filter results.

### 2. Critical Features
__Input__
- origin
- start date
- list of destinations with number of days
- number of people
- approximate budget

__Output__
- Itinerary Overview  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  - hotel location (address)
  - mode of transportation (will begin with only driving)
  - number of days
  - dates (perhaps on a calendar)
- cost
